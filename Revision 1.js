// Difference between var,let and const
//var is a best way to declare variables in javascript
//let can be re declared in the same scope but can be reassigned
//const cannot be re declared or reassigned

//What happens if you try to reassign values to variables declared with let or const
// With let you can reassign without error so longer as the variable is not re declared
// While with const you cannot reassign a const variable if you do it will probably cause a type error

// var x = 10;
// let y =5;
// const z =3;
x =20;
y =15;
z =7;
console.log(x,y,z);
